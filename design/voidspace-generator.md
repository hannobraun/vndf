# Voidspace Generator

## Description

Within 5-dimensional spacetime, the coordinates at the end of it are called voidspace. Or the beginning. Maybe the bottom? Science journalists never figured out a good metaphor. In any case, voidspace is a safe place. Not much happens there. If life were a game, and you wanted to opt out of it for a whole, voidspace is where you'd go to do that.

The voidspace generator is a specialized piece of machinery that computes the vector to voidspace from your current position and folds space around you to get you there. This takes quite a bit of energy, so allow for some time to charge it up.
