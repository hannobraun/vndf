# Backstory

## History

There once was a peaceful, spacefaring civilization that had started to colonize its own solar system. One day, a fleet of aggressive von Neumann probes arrived and started attacking the civilization. Eventually, the civilization managed to end the war using a computer virus that attacked the probe's networked hive mind, permanently shutting down their cognitive thinking ability. By this time, most was already lost.

The probes are still around, but they no longer pose an existential threat. They have turned feral, only following their instincts as dictated by their lower-level programming. Meanwhile the remnants of the civilization have adapted to their new life in space, their homeworld and all the larger colonies having been destroyed during the war. They have appropriated the probe's technology and even changed their own biology in order to survive.

## Players

Some of the remnants of the civilization have given up on who they previously were completely, fully fusing their bodies with technology, essentially becoming the spaceships that house whatever remains of their former bodies.

The player takes the role of such spaceship being, doing what it takes to survive in this post-apocalyptic world.
