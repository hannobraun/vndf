# Soul Pod

## Description

As bio-interfacing technology became practical and wide-spread, people started building bio-enhanced machines. And machine-enhanced people.

Nobody can quite tell which one this is. The lines started to get really blurry at some point. What it does, is house the mental capacities of a sentient being, allowing it to interface with complex machinery, like a spaceship.

## Transfer

Transfer yourself to this soul pod, leaving your current one empty. Well, technically, it wouldn't *have* to be left empty, but dealing with clones tends to be quite troublesome. Unless someone figures out how to disable their survival instincts, you'd never be able to transfer back.
